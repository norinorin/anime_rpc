## üöÄ Features

- üìÇ **Per-folder metadata with `.rpc` files**  
  Configure rich presence info for local media players like MPC and MPV by placing `.rpc` files in your anime folders

- üîÑ **Real-time presence updates**  
  Edits to `.rpc` files are picked up instantly, so your Discord status stays in sync without restarting anything.

- üéâ **Discord Rich Presence without running Discord**  
  Show what you‚Äôre watching without needing the Discord client open via OAuth2.

- üì∫ **Automatic anime episode tracking & metadata scraping**  
  Scrapes anime details and episode info from MyAnimeList with caching.

- üé≠ **Dynamic activity name**  
  The activity status adapts to what you‚Äôre watching, showing the anime title instead of a generic label (see [#14](https://github.com/norinorin/anime_rpc/pull/14)).

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/norinorin/anime_rpc.git

```sh
pip install -e .

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Playback Configuration

**anime_rpc** looks for a configuration file named `.rpc` (short for Rich Presence Config‚Äînot to be confused with Remote Procedure Call, or even Rich Presence Client :p) in the anime folder you're watching. If no such file is found, the folder is ignored.

There are two ways to set the metadata:

<details>

<summary>1. Automatically via MAL scraper (recommended)</summary>

---

To use the scraper, you only need to set the `url` key to the respective MAL page. This will automatically get the title, image URL, and episode titles (if run using `--fetch-episode-titles`) for the presence.

```env
# rpc.config
url=MAL_URL_HERE
```

---

</details>

<details>

<summary>2. Manually</summary>

---

Refer to [the example config](example.rpc) to get started.
